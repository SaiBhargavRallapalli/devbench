# Performance budget

**Purpose:** Keep “fast enough” objective for flagship routes under real conditions (ads/analytics present).  
**Tooling:** Chrome Lighthouse (mobile + desktop), Web Vitals in production (`@vercel/speed-insights`), optional RUM.

## Routes to measure (minimum)

- `/` (home)
- `/json`
- `/pdf`
- `/graph-calculator`
- One heavy tool page under `/tools/[slug]` (rotate quarterly, e.g. large editor or PDF tool)

## Budgets (initial targets — adjust with real RUM)

Measured on **throttled 4G / mid-tier mobile** Lighthouse simulation unless noted.

| Metric | Target (mobile) | Notes |
|--------|-----------------|--------|
| **LCP** | ≤ 2.5 s | Hero / main content visible; ads may defer — optimize critical path. |
| **INP** | ≤ 200 ms | Interactions on JSON / graph must stay responsive. |
| **CLS** | ≤ 0.1 | Avoid layout shift on font/theme load; stable toolbars (`shrink-0`, `min-h-0`). |
| **TBT** (Lighthouse lab) | ≤ 300 ms | Third-party scripts dominate; track regressions, not absolutes. |

**Desktop** targets: LCP ≤ 1.8 s, INP ≤ 150 ms as stretch goals.

## Product-specific rules

1. **Service worker** (`public/sw.js`) — caches `/_next/static/*` only; do not expand to document/RSC without an invalidation design.
2. **Code splitting** — prefer dynamic import for command palette and other below-the-fold heavy UI (already pattern in repo where applicable).
3. **Images** — `loading="lazy"` / appropriate dimensions for marketing images.

## Process

- Before major releases: run Lighthouse on the five routes above; attach PDF or scores to release notes if regressing.
- If **lab** and **RUM** disagree, trust RUM for INP/LCP on real devices.
